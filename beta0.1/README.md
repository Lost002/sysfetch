## Beta 0.1 Usage
1. 
    - source make.sh (from the prjects make directory)
    - restart bash (You may also have to reboot)
    - Then, Just run ```sysfetch```!
2.  
    - run the sysfetch main.py file (**e.g.** On a normal git clone: python3 /sysfetch/src/main.py)
## Fixing make.sh gone wrong
```sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/SysFetch/```
